Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced risk analytics professional with a demonstrated history of working in the credit and fraud risk 
industry. I was involved in the deployment of predictive risk models for small and medium enterprises to help 
provide data driven decision support and strategy support to credit policy, collections, and product teams. I am 
skilled in analyzing large datasets in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, generating recommendations, and presenting 
them to the stakeholders through visuals in Microsoft PowerPoint and Tableau.

Currently, I am pursuing the Master of Science in Business Analytics at Michigan State University. 
Through this program, I am seeking to further expand my breadth of technical knowledge of machine learning, 
formalize my business acumen, as well as get further industry exposure through experiential learning.

I am passionate about problems that can be solved through data and always looking for opportunities where I can 
enhance my Data Analytics/Data Science Skills.

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton or reading a nice book.
